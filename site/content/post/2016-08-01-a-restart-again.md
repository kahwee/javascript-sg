I haven't been maintaining my blogs well and they tend to get hacked due to my negligence. Each time there's a hack I restart the blog and lose content that I spent ages constructing.

The losing content part always saddens me.

In order for better sadness management, I'll shift my content to GitHub and write under Creative Commons.

Let's hope this goes right this time around.
